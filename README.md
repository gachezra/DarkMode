# DarkMode Color Sampler

This is a simple web application that allows users to sample a base color and preview its dark mode version. It provides a visual representation of how the selected color would appear in a dark mode environment.

## How it Works

1. **Select Base Color**: Use the color picker input to choose your desired base color. This color represents the color you want to sample.

2. **Preview Dark Mode Color**: The application dynamically calculates and displays the dark mode version of the selected base color. The dark mode color is created by darkening the RGB components of the base color.

3. **Test Your Colors**: Optionally, you can click on the "Test Your Colors" link to visit an external website called [Realtime Colors](https://realtimecolors.com) for further color testing and exploration.

## Features

- User-friendly interface with a simple color picker for selecting base colors.
- Instant preview of the dark mode version of the selected color.

## Technologies Used
